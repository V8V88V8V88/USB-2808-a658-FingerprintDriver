RTS5811+FT9366 fingerprint  driver with VID: 2808 and PID: a658 for ubuntu, fedora, centos, suse...

Note: This version of the libfprint should support USB 2808:a658 in an experimental version but It need fprintd, fprintd-pam as dependencies I will try to find the exact version compatbible with this version.
